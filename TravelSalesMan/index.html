        <p id="instructionLabel"><b>Information: </b>The traveling salesman problem is a problem where a brute force approach to finding the shortest path between nodes results in unreasonable computation time even for small input sizes. Solutions to the problem are heuristics, or approximations of the best solution. Though not guarenteed to be THE optimal solution, heuristic algorithmns function in a reasonable time limit. The above uses the Marching Ants Algorithm. Virtual ants go node to node (at first randomly). After all ants of a generation complete their journeys, the best paths have virtual "pheremones" added to them. In subsequent generations, ants are inclined to follow those paths with the highest pheremones (and add their own). Right click to add the starting node. Left click to add intermediate nodes, and right click again to add the end node. Graphic toggle allows you to see the connections between nodes, but slows total execution. AutoGen continously increments the generations.<br></p>
