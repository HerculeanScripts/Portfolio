    <p id="instructionLabel"><b>Information: </b>Conway's game of life is an example of (biological seeming) emergence from a set of simple rules. If a cell is surrounded by more than 3 or less than 2 neighbors, it dies (of over and underpopulation, respectively). If it has two or three live cells next to it, it becomes / stays alive. Click to add cells. Use slider to control the speed.</p>
